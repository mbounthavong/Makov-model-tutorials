# Introduction to Markov models in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

This is a repository of materials for the VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) cyberseminar on "Introduction to Markov Models in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis."

These seminars took place over two days:
- Wednesday, 14 February 2024 @ 11:00 am to 12:00 pm (PT)
- Wednesday, 28 February 2024 @ 11:00 am to 12:00 pm (PT)
- Recordings are located on the VA HERC cyberseminar site ([part 1](https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/for_researchers/cyber_seminars/archives/video_archive.cfm?SessionID=6473) and [part 2](https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/for_researchers/cyber_seminars/archives/video_archive.cfm?SessionID=6476))

Reading materials for the seminar are located in the [Readings folder](https://github.com/mbounthavong/Makov-model-tutorials/tree/main/Readings).

## Markov model Excel tutorial
A tutorial on how to construct a Markov model using Excel is available [here](https://rpubs.com/mbounthavong/markov_model_using_excel).

## Presentation on Introduction to Markov Models
The presentation on Markov Models is available [here](https://github.com/mbounthavong/Makov-model-tutorials/tree/main/Presentations)

## Tutorials on how to apply survival functions in Markov models
I wrote two tutorials on how to digitize data from a Kaplan-Meier curve and calculate the Weibull function parameters to use in a Markov model. This will allow users to create a Markov process using the survival function. 

The first part involves digitizing data from a KM curve and then using R to estimate the Weibull function parameters ([Part 1](https://mbounthavong.com/blog/2018/3/15/generating-survival-curves-from-study-data-an-application-for-markov-models-part-1-of-2))

The second part uses the Weibull survival function in a Markov model ([Part 2](https://mbounthavong.com/blog/2018/3/15/generating-survival-curves-from-study-data-an-application-for-markov-models-part-2-of-2)).
