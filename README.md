# Introduction to Markov models in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis


Materials for the VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) course on "Introduction to Markov Models in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis" will be uploaded prior to the start of the seminar on Wednesday, 14 February 2024.

This seminar will take place over two days:
- Wednesday, 14 February 2024 @ 11:00 am to 12:00 pm (PT)
- Wednesday, 28 February 2024 @ 11:00 am to 12:00 pm (PT)

Reading materials for the seminar are located in the [Readings folder](https://github.com/mbounthavong/Makov-model-tutorials/tree/main/Readings).

## Markov model Excel tutorial
A tutorial on how to construct a Markov model using Excel is available [here](https://rpubs.com/mbounthavong/markov_model_using_excel).

## Presentation on Introduction to Markov Models
The presentation on Markov Models is available [here](https://github.com/mbounthavong/Makov-model-tutorials/tree/main/Presentations)

## Tutorial on how to apply survival functions in Markov models
I wrote two tutorials on how to digitize data from a Kaplan-Meier curve and calculate the Weibull function parameters to use in a Markov model. This will allow users to create a Markov process using the survival function. 

The first part involves digitizing data from a KM curve and then using R to estimate the Weibull function parameters ([Part 1](https://mbounthavong.com/blog/2018/3/15/generating-survival-curves-from-study-data-an-application-for-markov-models-part-1-of-2))

The second part uses the Weibull survival function in a Markov model ([Part 2](https://mbounthavong.com/blog/2018/3/15/generating-survival-curves-from-study-data-an-application-for-markov-models-part-2-of-2)).
